#![allow(unsafe_code)]
//! The core implementation of the concurrent trie data structure.
//!
//! This module contains the [`Raw`][crate::raw::Raw] type, which is the engine of all the data
//! structures in this crate. This is exposed to allow wrapping it into further APIs, but is
//! probably not the best thing for general use.

// # The data structure
//
// The data structure is inspired by the [article] and [Wikipedia entry], however severely
// simplified. Compared to the article, what we don't do (if you don't want to read the article,
// that's fine, explanation is below):
//
// * We don't have variable-sized inner nodes. This wastes some more space, but also allows us to
//   keep the same node around instead of creating a new one every time we want to add or remove a
//   pointer.
// * We don't do snapshots for iterations.
// * We got rid of the I-nodes. This gets rid of half of the pointer loads on the way to the
//   element, so in theory it should make the data structure about twice faster.
//
// By this simplification, we lose the ability of having consistent iterations and we use somewhat
// more memory, but get faster data structure. More importantly, the data structure is simpler to
// implement and simpler to prove correct which makes it more likely to actually trust it with some
// data.
//
// ## How it works
//
// The heart of the data structure is a trie where keys are prefixes of the 64bit hash of the key.
// Each inner node has 16 pointer slots, indexed by the next 4 bits of the hash. When we reach a
// level where the prefix is unique, we stop (we don't have all 16 levels of inner nodes if we
// don't have to) and place a data node.
//
// A data nodes contain one or more elements (more in case we get a hash collision on the whole
// hash ‒ in that case, we store all the colliding elements in an array and distinguish by equality
// of the keys in a linear search through the array).
//
// On lookup, we either find the correct element or stop at the first null pointer encountered.
//
// On insertion, if we find a null pointer, we atomically replace that pointer to a new data node
// containing (only) the new element, using the CaS operation. In case we reach a collision or
// replace an existing element, we create a new data node and replace the pointer, again using the
// CaS operation. If we find a non-matching data node in our way, we need to insert another level ‒
// we create a brand new inner node, link the old node there and again, replace the pointer (then
// retry with our insertion on the next level).
//
// Deletion looks up the element and either replaces the pointer to the data node with null (if it
// was the last one), or creates a new data node without the element.
//
// ## Pruning
//
// If implemented as above, the data structure would work. However, deletions would leave unneeded
// dead branches or branches that don't branch (eg. linear ones) behind. That would make the data
// structure perform worse than necessary, because the lookups would have to traverse the dead or
// non-branching branches and it would need more memory. Therefore, after we remove an element, we
// want to walk the path back towards the root and remove the nodes that are no longer needed
// (either remove the branch completely or contract the end that doesn't branch).
//
// If we, however, started to simply delete the nodes and replace the pointers with nulls, we would
// get race conditions:
//
// 1. We check that the current node is empty (or has only one pointer to data in it) and therefore
//    is unneeded.
// 2. After we do the check but before we manage to update the pointer that points to the current
//    node, some other thread adds a new pointer into the node. This would make it ineligible for
//    deletion, but we've already done our check.
// 3. We don't know about the addition from the other thread and go ahead with the deletion. This
//    loses and leaks the added element, or any update the other thread has done.
//
// The original article used the I-nodes and another kind of nodes to solve this problem. We are
// going to get inspired by what they did, but will do it inline in the array of pointers.
//
// On any sane system, data structures like our inner or data nodes are aligned to multiples of
// some number (assuming we have at least 32bit system, it's at least multiple of 4 bytes). This
// leaves two bits that are always 0 in the pointers. We can abuse these bits to store additional
// flags (we use the utilities of crossbeam_utils to manage the bits). One of these bits, when set
// to 1, will mean that the pointer is no longer allowed to be updated.
//
// So, when removing, we first check once if the inner node may be removed. If not, we're done. If
// it looks like it may be, we walk the pointers again, but this time we atomically read and mark
// them with the flag. This'll make sure nobody is allowed to sneak an update to it past our second
// check (the first one is just an optimisation). So, if we pass the second check, we can safely
// proceed and remove the node. Hurray. We can move one level up towards the root and repeat.
//
// In case the second check failed, we have already marked all the pointers that they are never
// ever allowed to be updated again. We can't leave a node like that in the data structure forever.
// Therefore, we create a new copy of the node, with clean pointers and replace the node with that
// (in that case we can stop the processing at this level).
//
// So, what the other thread that wants to update the pointer but can't because it is marked does?
// It can't wait for the thread that did the marking to finish its job, because then the algorithm
// would no longer be lock-free. But it can decide to do its work for it and also do the pruning
// (only of this particular one inner node; it won't walk further towards the root). It proceeds to
// the second check stage ‒ marks all the pointers (even if they are already marked) and deciding
// if it can remove it completely or if it needs to create a brand new copy. One of the threads
// competing for the prune operation will succeed, the other will fail during the CaS update of the
// parent pointer, but both can proceed because the pruning already happened.
//
// As this collision on node being prune is likely to be rare in practice and it is already
// relatively complex (and hard to test for) situation, the other thread simply completely restarts
// the operation instead of trying to get all the corner cases right. The removal thread, however,
// proceeds towards the root even in the collision situation ‒ it is responsible for pruning as far
// as possible and when going up, the corner cases don't actually happen (well, with the exception
// of its whole branch being already removed or contracted away by another removal, but in that
// case it'll just waste a little bit of effort in trying to remove stuff in places that are going
// to be thrown away anyway ‒ but thanks to crossbeam_epoch, it is still valid memory).
//
// ## Iteration
//
// Similar to lookups, iteration doesn't have to care about the flags about non-updateable
// pointers ‒ even the old, marked, pointers form a valid representation of the map at a certain
// point of time, though not necessarily optimally small.
//
// Therefore, the iterator simply keeps a stack of nodes it is in, with indices into either the
// pointer array or the array of elements in a data node and does a DFS through the data structure.
//
// # Safety
//
// The current module contains a lot of unsafe code. In general, there are two kinds of things that
// could go wrong. Well, in addition to coding bugs, of course.
//
// ## Lifetimes & invalid pointers
//
// First, we simply never insert pointers that would be invalid at that time into the data
// structure ‒ whatever gets inserted is just brand new allocated thing. This boils down to just
// being careful and, as this is relatively short code, this is possible to accomplish.
//
// So, we must make sure nothing gets destroyed too soon. To accomplish this, we use the mechanism
// of crossbeam_epoch. When we remove something from the data structure, the destruction is
// postponed to when all the threads leave the current epoch. We never hold onto the pointers or
// references past the current method and we bind the lifetimes of the references to the lifetime
// of passed pin and us.
//
// There are two exceptions to this:
//
// * The destructor deletes things right away. But as it holds a mutable reference, we can't be
//   destroying anything for any other thread ‒ the other thread no longer holds reference to us.
// * The iterator binds the lifetimes to both itself and the map, but it holds a pin alive, so the
//   same would still apply.
//
// ## Inter-thread synchronization of data.
//
// In general, we use release ordering when putting data into the map and consume ordering when
// reading it out of it. The claim is, this is enough. But as the elements are independent on each
// other and only the inner nodes we traverse during the operation play any role to us (and we
// access the further nodes through the loaded pointers) and there's exactly one path from the root
// to each element (therefore anyone getting the element must have touched the same pointers), this
// is basically the definition of how release/consume synchronization edges work.
//
// There are some other orderings through the code, though:
//
// * Relaxed in case we *fail* a CaS update. However, in such case nothing is modified and we just
//   throw the data we've created ourselves out, so there's nothing to synchronize.
// * Relaxed in the first check for pruning. This one does not look at the actual data behind the
//   pointers, it simply counts how many pointers are non-null. The second pass does the actual
//   proper synchronization.
// * Relaxed in the is_empty. As we don't care what data it points to (only that it's not null),
//   this again doesn't have to synchronize anything.
// * Relaxed in the destructor. As argued above (and at the destructor itself), we have gained a
//   unique access to the whole map. Therefore, the whole map, containing the data in it must have
//   been properly synchronized into the thread already and we are in a single-threaded scenario.
// * AcqRel in the pruning. This is because we need to acquire the data pointed to in the case
//   we'll be making a copy and we'll have to re-release it later on. We also modify the value of
//   the pointer (with the flag), therefore anyone reading it after us only synchronizes against
//   us, so we also need to re-release it right now onto that pointer.
